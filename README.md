Leder
====================

Leder is a mobile outlining app for journalists. Using Leder, journalists can import notes from various sources, extract quotes, rearrange those quotes, and export a finished outline to their computer to use as a base for articles. 

### Status

I am currently writing Leder in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, using the AngularJS and Ionic frameworks. The application is scheduled for completion December 2015. Feel free to [follow updates on my project blog](http://www.sanettetanaka.com/thoughts/).
